# Contenful Listener API

**‚ö†Ô∏è  This application is experimental ü™Ñ and is not currently a part of the GOV.UK stack**

An application that keeps content managed in a [Contentful][] CMS instance in-sync with the GOV.UK Publishing API. It listens for Contentful webhooks that affect individual content items and updates GOV.UK content accordingly. It is intended to be used for bespoke pages on GOV.UK which are not handled by the internal GOV.UK CMS tools.

[Contentful]: https://www.contentful.com/

## Technical documentation

This application is built using the [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/) microframework for Ruby HTTP applications.

<!-- TODO: replace below following integration with GOV.UK Docker -->
<!-- You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) to run the application and its tests with the GOV.UK dependencies. Follow [the usage instructions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker#usage) to get started. -->

This application is not currently configured with [GOV.UK Docker](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) and thus should be run on your host machine using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv).

### Running the test suite

```
bundle exec rake
```

### Running the app with Contentful

<!-- TODO: update following integration with GOV.UK Docker -->

<!-- While you can run this app with GOV.UK Docker without additional configuration, this doesn't integrate with Contentful so may be of limited use. To use this application locally with a Contentful instance you will need to do some additional configuration both locally and in Contentful. -->

To use this application locally with a Contentful instance you will need to do some additional configuration both locally and in Contentful. You will also need a running instance of Publishing API (`govuk-docker up publishing-api-app-lite`).

In Contentful you need to [create API access tokens][access-tokens] for the spaces you need to access (see [access_tokens configuration](config/access_tokens.yaml.erb) for the space ids and environment variable names). You should scope the access token to a [sandbox environment][] you have created to avoid changing any of the live content.

In order for your application instance to receive Contentful webhooks, you will need to use software to expose the application to the public internet. [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) is a good option.

<!--
You can then start the application with GOV.UK Docker:

```
$ govuk-docker run -p 9292:9292 \
-e CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=<environment name> \
-e <environment variable prefix for your space>_DRAFT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<draft access token> \
-e <envrionment variable prefix for your space>_LIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<live access token> \
contentful-listener-api-app \
bundle exec puma
```
-->

You can then start the application with:

```
$ CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=<environment name> \
<environment variable prefix for your space>_DRAFT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<draft access token> \
<envrionment variable prefix for your space>_LIVE_ACCESS_TOKEN=<live access token> \
bundle exec puma
```

and expose it to the public internet with `$ ngrok http 9292`. This will output a forwarding URL.

To complete the set-up you need to [create a webhook][] in Contentful and point it to send POST requests to the `/listener` path of your forwarding URL.

When you make changes in the Contentful UI you should see webhooks being received by the application. You can see a log of the attempts to call the endpoint in the Contentful web interface with the webhook settings.

Once you have completed your development session, you should go into the Contentful web interface and delete your webhook, your sandbox environment and your access token.
